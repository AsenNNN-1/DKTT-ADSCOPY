# C2: Hook Generator

Transform product benefits into scroll-stopping opening lines.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Input
Identify:
- Core problem solved (pain point elimination)
- Key transformation promise (before/after state)
- Target audience triggers
- Unique product angles
- Most compelling benefits

### Step 2: Apply Structural Formulas
- [Problem Call-Out] + [Implied Solution]
- [Bold Claim] + [Specificity Element]
- [POV Setup] + [Desirable Outcome]
- [Curiosity Gap] + [Payoff Tease]
- [Social Proof Element] + [Result]

### Step 3: Incorporate Psychological Triggers
- Specificity elements ("Day 7," "$23," "2 weeks")
- Transformation language ("finally," "changed everything," "wish I knew sooner")
- Exclusivity framing ("nobody talks about," "they don't want you to know")
- Identity triggers ("girls with [problem]," "if you're someone who")
- Urgency hints ("before it sells out," "while it's still available")

### Step 4: Create Contrasts
- Pair small effort with big results
- Create intrigue through unexpected combinations
- Highlight counterintuitive approaches

## Example Hooks

**Problem Call-Out:**
- "Stop buying [category] until you see this"
- "If you struggle with [problem], watch this"
- "The reason your [routine] isn't working"
- "Girls with [problem] — run don't walk"

**Transformation/Proof:**
- "The $27 product that replaced my $200 [item]"
- "Day 14 and I'm never going back"
- "3 weeks ago I would have never believed this"
- "Wait til you see the before and after"

**Curiosity/Discovery:**
- "POV: You finally found the one that actually works"
- "Nobody talks about why this works so fast"
- "I was today years old when I learned this"
- "I need everyone to know about this immediately"
- "My [family member] is gonna be so mad I'm sharing this"
