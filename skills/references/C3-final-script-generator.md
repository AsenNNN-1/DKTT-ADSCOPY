# C3: Final Script Generator

Generate complete, high-converting TikTok sales scripts in three distinct archetypes.

## Phase 1: Context Gathering Interview

Begin with:
> "Let's understand your product and who needs it. I'll ask you 5-7 focused questions to create scripts that actually convert."

Ask one at a time:

1. **Product & Problem:** "What product are you selling and what specific problem does it solve? Be as concrete as possible."

2. **Target Audience:** "Who is your ideal buyer? What's their situation when they realize they need this?"

3. **Failed Alternatives:** "What has your audience tried before that didn't work? What frustrated them about those attempts?"

4. **Transformation Promise:** "What's the before and after? What changes in their life after using this product?"

5. **Proof Available:** "What evidence do you have that it works? (Results, testimonials, demonstrations, credentials)"

6. **[Optional]:** "What objections do people have before buying? What makes them hesitate?"

7. **[If needed]:** "What's the price point and how does that compare to alternatives?"

After gathering, summarize:
> "Here's what I understand about your product and audience: [brief summary]. Now I'll create 9 scripts - 3 variations of each archetype."

## Phase 2: Script Generation

Generate exactly 9 scripts:

### Set 1: The Relatable Sufferer (3 variations)
- Focus on validating struggle before revealing product
- Use frustration escalation (tried this → tried that → gave up → found this)
- Natural product introduction as personal discovery
- Soft, trust-building CTA
- **Length: 30-45 seconds**

### Set 2: The Dramatic Transformer (3 variations)
- Lead with visual transformation or bold claim
- Show proof early and often
- Use specificity for credibility (exact timeframes, numbers)
- Direct, urgency-driven CTA
- **Length: 15-30 seconds**

### Set 3: The Casual Discoverer (3 variations)
- Frame as genuine discovery or recommendation
- Use "POV" or "storytime" energy
- Minimal selling, maximum sharing
- No-pressure, optional CTA
- **Length: 20-40 seconds**

## Script Structure

Each script must include:
```
[HOOK]: Scroll-stopping first line (under 3 seconds spoken)
[PROBLEM]: Relatable pain articulation
[TURN]: Natural transition to solution
[SOLUTION]: Product introduction
[SHOW: visual direction]
[PROOF]: Evidence or demonstration
[CTA]: Call-to-action appropriate to archetype
```

## Power Techniques

- Use "you" for immediate involvement
- Include specific numbers for credibility
- Create one memorable moment per script
- Write for spoken delivery (contractions, casual grammar)
- Include [SHOW: ...] notes for visual moments

## Output Format

### THE RELATABLE SUFFERER SCRIPTS

**Variation 1: [Angle/Theme]**
```
[HOOK]: "..."

[PROBLEM]: "..."

[TURN]: "..."

[SOLUTION]: "..."
[SHOW: ...]

[PROOF]: "..."

[CTA]: "..."
```

[Repeat for Variations 2-3]

### THE DRAMATIC TRANSFORMER SCRIPTS

[Same format, 3 variations]

### THE CASUAL DISCOVERER SCRIPTS

**Why:** [2-3 sentences on conversion potential]

**A/B Test against:** [Archetype - Variation #]

**Wild card:** [Archetype - Variation #]

## Constraints

- Never sound like an advertisement
- Avoid corporate language or obvious selling phrases
- No "revolutionary" or "game-changing" - use real language
- Each variation should feel distinct
- Match TikTok's native, casual, authentic tone
- Keep scripts under 60 seconds when read aloud
