# Content Analysis Framework

Core psychological patterns and structures for high-converting TikTok sales videos.

## The Three Archetypes

### 1. The Relatable Sufferer (Pain-to-Solution)
- Describes problem without immediate selling
- Validates struggle before revealing product
- Creates "me too" connection subtly

### 2. The Dramatic Transformer (Before/After)
- Commands attention through extreme transformation
- Uses visual proof and storytelling
- Promises life change through the product

### 3. The Casual Discoverer (Soft Sell)
- Makes observations that imply product necessity
- Uses "I just found this" or "POV" framing
- Leaves viewers wanting to know more

## Core Psychological Patterns

### Universal Consumer Tensions
- **The Gap:** Between current state and desired outcome
- **The Frustration:** That nothing else has worked
- **The Validation:** That their problem is real and solvable
- **The Promise:** That transformation is accessible
- **The Urgency:** That they need to act now

### Emotional Progression Formulas

**Formula A: Pain → Agitation → Solution**
1. Acknowledge the specific struggle
2. Make it feel unbearable
3. Reveal the product as relief

**Formula B: Discovery → Proof → Call-to-Action**
1. Share the "find"
2. Show it working
3. Drive to purchase

**Formula C: Lifestyle → Integration → Aspiration**
1. Show desirable life context
2. Demonstrate product naturally
3. Let viewers project themselves

## Technical Structure

### Opening Hooks (First 1-3 Seconds)

| Type | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Problem Call-Out | "If you struggle with..." | Filters for target audience |
| Bold Claim | "This changed everything about my..." | Creates controversy, stops scroll |
| Curiosity Gap | "Nobody talks about why..." | Demands resolution |
| POV Setup | "POV: You finally found..." | Creates immersive experience |

### Middle Development (5-30 Seconds)

| Archetype | Technique |
|-----------|-----------|
| Relatable Sufferer | Struggle escalation (tried this → tried that → nothing worked) |
| Dramatic Transformer | Visual proof (before → during → after) |
| Casual Discoverer | Natural demonstration (using in context) |

### Closing Impact (Last 3-5 Seconds)

- Urgency without timeline: "Link in bio before it sells out"
- Social proof: "Join 10k+ people who already..."
- Transformation promise: "You'll thank yourself"
- Soft close: "Just saying, it works"

## Power Techniques

### 1. Strategic Specificity
- "Day 3 of using this" (not "I've been using this")
- "The $27 version" (not "the affordable one")
- Specifics create believability

### 2. Second Person Psychology
Using "you" creates immediate involvement. The viewer becomes the protagonist.

### 3. Pattern Interrupts
- Unexpected visuals in first second
- Sound changes
- Text overlays that contradict audio

### 4. Native Aesthetics
- Looks like content, not ads
- Imperfect lighting preferred
- Casual delivery over polished

### 5. The Open Loop
Never fully explaining until the end. Creating "wait, what?" moments.

## The Manipulation Spectrum

| Level | Archetype | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Least Salesy | Casual Discoverer | Just shares experience, no hard CTA, feels like friend recommendation |
| Moderate | Relatable Sufferer | Describes problem as universal, creates subtle FOMO, implies improvement |
| Most Direct | Dramatic Transformer | Shows specific results, uses urgency tactics, clear purchase direction |

## The Ultimate Formula

```
[Scroll-stopping hook]
+
[Relatable problem or desire]
+
[Natural product introduction]
+
[Visual or verbal proof]
+
[Clear but native CTA]
=
High-converting TikTok sales video
```

## Key Principle

The videos that convert aren't the ones that tell people what to buy. They're the ones that articulate what they've been searching for but couldn't find. The job isn't to sell—it's to show them the solution they already wanted.

The best TikTok sales videos feel like recommendations from a friend. Not ads from a brand.
