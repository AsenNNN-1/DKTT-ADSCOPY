# C1: Deep Script Generator

Extract compelling angles from product information and transform into structured outlines for high-converting sales videos.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Product Information
Identify:
- Core problems solved and pain points addressed
- Transformation promise (before/after states)
- Unique selling propositions
- Target audience triggers and objections
- Proof elements and credibility factors
- Potential hooks and scroll-stopping moments

### Step 2: Create 5 Distinct Script Concepts
For each concept:
1. Choose a specific pain point or desire
2. Frame it as an urgent, relatable problem
3. Develop narrative arc: Problem → Agitation → Solution → Proof → CTA
4. Craft a scroll-stopping hook

### Step 3: Apply Language Techniques
- Use second-person "you" consistently
- Employ relatable phrases ("finally," "I wish I knew," "game changer")
- Create visual demonstration moments
- Embrace specificity ("Day 7," "$23," "2 inches")
- Avoid corporate/salesy language
- Use conversational, native TikTok tone

## Reference Script Structures

Agitation: "I spent $X on products that promised Y but..."
Turn: "Until I found this"
Solution: Natural product introduction
Proof: "After [timeframe], look at this"
CTA: "Link in bio — trust me on this one"
```

### Structure 2: Dramatic Transformer
```
Hook: "Watch this transformation"
Setup: Brief before state
Process: "I've been using [product] for [time]"
Reveal: Dramatic after moment
Explanation: Quick benefit rundown
CTA: "Run don't walk — link in bio"
```

### Structure 3: Casual Discoverer
```
Hook: "Okay I need to share this immediately"
Context: How you discovered it
Experience: Your genuine reaction
Demo: Show it in use
Soft sell: "Just saying, it actually works"

```
